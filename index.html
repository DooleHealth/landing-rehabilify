However, rehabilitation needs professional long-term follow-up1, and often daily intervention. This is usually done at specialized/central/referral hospitals, which are often far from the patients' rural or isolated homes.<br>Failing to provide some form of rehabilitative service will increase morbidity and mortality; in areas where rehabilitative services are not available there is a bigger and increasing demand of acute care and long-term care services.<br>Demand for rehabilitation services is growing and it is expected to continue to be in high demand due to the ageing population, improvements in healthcare (survival rates from catastrophic injuries is higher than ever), and new technologies and treatments.</p></section><section class="section-rehabilify"><h2>What is REHABILIFY?</h2><p class="section-content">The <span class="highlight">rehabilify</span> solution offers a dual-system-based approach. On one side, a patient management center to all the involved professionals, following an integrated-care approach and incorporating a system to support decision-making. On the other hand, a patient with rehabilitation needs will benefit from an application that promotes self-management, behavioral change, and better follow-up.</p><p class="section-content"><span class="highlight">rehabilify</span> provides patients with intelligent support through suitable recommender systems focused on the main pillars of health adapted to each use-case and a managed digital community to provide peer support and motivation. To provide collaboration, cooperation, and continuous patients’ monitoring and follow-up, professionals have access to a management system that includes decision support systems for risk stratification and care plan definition. The <span class="highlight">rehabilify</span> solution will be ready for integration with third-party solutions and devices thanks to an open portal that enables and supports a unique access point for prescription of remote rehabilitation solutions.</p><nav><ul><li><a href="#functional" role="button"><img src="img/functional.svg" alt="opens functional modal" class="border-rainbow"><p>Functional</p></a></li><li><a href="#integration" role="button"><img src="img/integration.svg" alt="opens integration modal" class="border-rainbow"><p>Integration</p></a></li><li><a href="#architecture" role="button"><img src="img/architecture.svg" alt="opens architecture modal" class="border-rainbow"><p>Architecture</p></a></li></ul></nav></section><section><h2>Documentation</h2><div class="section-content"><p>Documentation is essential to maintain efficiency and effectiveness in application development, deployment, and maintenance.</p><ul><li>Helps build within the team.

How health apps collect and use data can have profound implications for the individual and society as a whole. The development and governance of health apps therefore requires careful ethical consideration.<br>While this label focusses on the responsibilities of app manufacturers, it is important to note that the adherence to ethical principle is a shared responsibility between app manufacturers, deployers and end-users.
